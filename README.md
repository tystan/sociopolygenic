# sociopolygenic

R code to produce the bootstrapped GLMM (generalised linear mixed models) confidence intervals of longitudinal adiposity outcomes based on socioeconomic (dis)advantage as seen in the article:

* ["Socioeconomic disadvantage amplifies polygenic risk of ..." (Kerr et al.)](https://linktocome.com)


## Supplementary figures

Code to produce the below figures are here: [ovo_chi_sep_glmm_boot_ci.R](https://github.com/tystan/sociopolygenic/blob/main/r/2_plot_results.R)
